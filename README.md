# Django LocalLibraryApp

## Local Library Web App

> Django LocalLibraryApp is a full featured library management system built with django to manage the catalog for a local library.

- Use Django's tools to create a skeleton website and application.
- Create models to represent your application's data.
- Use the Django admin site to populate your site's data.
- Create views to retrieve specific data in response to different requests, and templates to render the data as HTML to be displayed in the browser.
- Create mappers to associate different URL patterns with specific views.
- Add user authorization and sessions to control site behavior and access.
- Work with forms.
- Write test code for your app.
- Use Django's security effectively.
- Deploy your application to production.

## Overview

This web application creates an online catalog for a small local library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts.

The main features that have currently been implemented are:

* There are models for books, book copies, genre, language and authors.
* Users can view list and detail information for books and authors.
* Admin users can create and manage models. The admin has been optimised (the basic registration is present in admin.py, but commented out).
* Librarians can renew reserved books

## Quick Start

To get this project up and running locally on your computer:
1. Set up the [Python development environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment).
   We recommend using a Python virtual environment.
1. Assuming you have Python setup, run the following commands (if you're on Windows you may use `py` or `py -3` instead of `python` to start Python):
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   python3 manage.py makemigrations
   python3 manage.py migrate
   python3 manage.py collectstatic
   python3 manage.py test # Run the standard tests. These should all pass.
   python3 manage.py createsuperuser # Create a superuser
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```
1. Open a browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to open the admin site
1. Create a few test objects of each type.
1. Open tab to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see the main site, with your new objects.
